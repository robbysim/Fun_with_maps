## Spaital analysis using Folium

### Overview 

This short project formalizes my understanding on the use of Folium and Geopandas to do basic geo-spatial analysis on mosquito traps locations and effect of mosquito spraying on mosquito numbers and West Nile Virus (WNV) rates. Folium is a great tool as it allows for different types of markers as well as time slider in addition to heatmap analysis. Maps generated can be exported in html format which can then be opened in a browser independently. 

Specific functions explored:
- CircleMarker
- TimeSliderChoropleth
- HeatMapWithTime
